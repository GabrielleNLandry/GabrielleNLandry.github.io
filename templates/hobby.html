        <p>In my free time, I love diving into different worlds through books, video games, and tabletop adventures. Reading has always been a favorite pastime, letting me explore new ideas and stories. Some of my favorite books include <em>Good Omens</em> by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett, and <em>The Martian</em> by Andy Weir. I also enjoy playing video games, and right now, <em>Baldurâ€™s Gate 3</em> is my current favorite. When I want a more interactive storytelling experience, I love playing Dungeons & Dragons, where I get to create characters, go on epic quests, and enjoy great adventures with friends.</p>
