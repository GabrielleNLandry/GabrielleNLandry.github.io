        <p>Hi! I'm Gabrielle Landry, a senior at Point Park University, majoring in Applied Computer Science with a concentration in Software Development. I have a passion for coding and problem-solving, and I’m excited to start my journey as a web developer. When I’m not working on projects, I love spending time with my boxer, Roscoe. In my free time, you can find me playing Dungeons & Dragons, enjoying video games, or getting lost in a good book. Some of my favorites include <em>Good Omens</em> by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett, and <em>The Martian</em> by Andy Weir.</p>
